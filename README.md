# Emotion Architecture in Reddit Comments  
*A Diagnostic and Predictive Exploration of Crowdsourced Emotional Labels*

## Project Overview

This project explores emotional patterns, rater bias, and label reliability in the [GoEmotions dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathurinache/goemotions) using Python and data science tools.

The EDA investigates:

- Annotation inconsistency and “neutral spamming”
- Emotion co-occurrence and correlation
- Contradictions between labels and textual signals
- Predictive performance using TF-IDF + Logistic Regression
- Semantic structure using Word2Vec + t-SNE

This project was presented as the final EDA project at **TovTech**.

## DataCamp Learning Experience

As part of this EDA, I studied statistics, data science, and modeling using the DataCamp platform. I learned to:
- Apply diagnostic thinking to real-world datasets
- Identify annotation bias and contradictions
- Use statistical tools to interpret NLP structures
- Process findings clearly under pressure

Despite a nontraditional background, this project helped me realize the power of clean logic, ethical scrutiny, and practical data skills.
